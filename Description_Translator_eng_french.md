Hi there! This is my English-French translator project. It's hands-down a great tool for anyone who's wishing to diversify their French vocabulary.
Think of it as a game of Charades! Every correct word guessed leads to the next.Â  When you can't guess one, then that word would add itself to a csv file for your reference.

Bonne chance! (Good luck!)
